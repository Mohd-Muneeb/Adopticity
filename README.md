### This is **Adopticity**.

A full stack application which is supposed to promote animal adoption for people who are looking to find a _perfect companion_.
Adopticity is developed on **Next.JS**. The backend of Adopticity is currently handled by **Google Firebase** including authentication, storage and many more.

Adopticity is open source as of now and any contributer is welcome to join in and give me a hand in developing the project.

I would really like to thank _daisyUI_ for helping me build the UI with extreme ease along with _Tailwind_ and many more.
A list of contributers will be made as contribution are made to the project and you can always reach out to me on mohdmuneeb@protonmail.com if you would like to mail me.

### Thank you once again.

_**Really appreciate your support**_
Mohd Muneeb.
